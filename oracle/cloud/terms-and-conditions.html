                not lose any of that data. You must not rely on Our back ups of that data.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>We may change the features, benefits or service items of any MySTCloud Service from time to time in Our

            insubstantial
            benefit of the MySTCloud Service then You may give Us written notice of that fact within 15 days of the
            change.&nbsp; If We receive such a notice from You and We are unable to agree with You an acceptable
            alternative within 30 days of the date that We made the change then You may:
            <ol class="alpha">

              <li>terminate that MySTCloud Service using the Service Management Functionality at any time up 30 days
