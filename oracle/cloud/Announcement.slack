A new update has been shipped to the oracle cloud beta tier (<https://docs.rubiconred.com/oracle/cloud/release-notes.html | RC20>)

*Improvements*
• Addressed an issue where connections were not being set when the embedded repository was being used.
• The stream model can now be updated at deployment time when it is missing configuration
• After a synchronisation, the integrations in the wizard are greyed out to not give the impression that more than one synchronisation can be performed at a time.
• Fixed screenshots in the guided journeys
• Improved `Add Aritfacts` screen display on smaller screens
