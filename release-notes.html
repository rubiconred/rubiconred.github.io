<h2 id="bug-fixes-16">Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>FC-4890 - MyST now allows one to re-target the Admin Server component on to another compute group and node to fix issues with topologies but does not do any proactive validation, hence is left to the user’s discretion</li>

<h2 id="new-features-17">New Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>FC-4370 - MyST now allows scheduling of release pipeline deployments for a future date / time. A previously scheduled deployment can be unscheduled as well if its execution time has not been reached yet.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-20">Improvements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>FC-4377 - Properties starting with ‘core.’ are no longer introspected by the MyST Jenkins Plugin so that conflicts can be avoided against the platform properties.</li>
  <li>FC-4343 - MyST now allows the user to mark properties in the artifact property registry as encrypted (passwords etc.) and if so, masks the artifact property values on the UI and persists them in encrypted form as well</li>
  <li>FC-4315 - For property keys containing the word ‘password’, MyST now automatically marks them as encrypted while registering them in the artifact property registry.</li>

  <li>FC-4375 - One can now bypass introspection of properties at the Job level while using the MyST Jenkins plugin. By default, the behaviour is to introspect the artifact properties and report to MyST.</li>
  <li>FC-4309 - The application blueprint association with platform blueprints has been deprecated from the UI as it has no relevance any more.</li>
  <li>FC-4345 - The MyST Jenkins plugin now has the ability perform a dry run whereby it will show the JSON payload that will be posted to MyST but will not actually send it, thereby allowing the user to validate the Job configuration without affecting the MyST instance.</li>
  <li>FC-3970 - WebLogic resources such as File Stores and JDBC Data Sources can now be created without targeting them to any servers or clusters.</li>
  <li>FC-4157 - MyST now captures the user who is committing configuration changes to platform blueprints and models in addition to the commit message.</li>

  <li>FC-4179 - While reverse registering artifacts, the MyST Jenkins plugin now raises a ‘Conflict Detected’ exception if a duplicate build is posted to the target MyST Studio instance. (A very likely cause of this would be a missing step in the Job to bump the artifact version)</li>
  <li>FC-4369 - While reverse registering artifacts, the MyST Jenkins Plugin now considers the MyST Config Plan by default when introspecting artifact properties</li>
  <li>FC-4324 - All modal dialogs in the MyST user interface can now be maximized to occupy full screen width and height so that overflowing content can be easily visualized</li>

<h1 id="myst-studio-5500">MyST Studio 5.5.0.0</h1>

<h2 id="new-features-18">New Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>FC-4277 - The MyST Plugin for Jenkins has added support for introspecting property references within the source code to simplify deploy-time customisation.</li>
  <li>FC-4279 - There is now an Artifact Property Registry which shows introspected properties and the Artifacts which reference them as well as allowing the definition of meaningful descriptions and defaults values</li>
  <li>FC-4292 - Properties can be referenced by multiple artifacts so that if the property changes it will apply to all Artifacts which reference that property.</li>
  <li>FC-4291 - MyST will automatically determine which properties need to be defined based on the artifacts in a given deployment. This will generate a Stage Model which can be updated with the environment-specific values for deploy-time</li>
  <li>FC-4282 - The Stage Model is persisted at the platform instance-level so you only need to enter the values for the first deployment and when they need to change</li>
  <li>FC-4290 - MyST will show the exact Artifact version and build number in the deploy-time prompt for the Approver and Deployer</li>
  <li>FC-4281 - A CSV file of Application Models grouped by Application Blueprint Versions can be exported through the API</li>

  <li>Performance improvements while rendering the Platform Blueprint, Model and Instance screens</li>

  <li>MyST now supports an additional flag argument, ‘limit-nodes’ which can be set to limit the action to specific nodes. All actions which manage start / stop lifecycle of servers / machines honor this (patch, stop, stop-all, start-all, restart-all, start-nm, stop-nm, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-48">Improvements</h2>

  <li>The memory settings in the Advanced configuration step of the platform model wizard now show MFT, BAM and ESS</li>
  <li>For pre-existing infrastructure, MyST now only establishes connectivity with the Admin node. For on-demand, it establishes connectivity with all the nodes as before.</li>
  <li>Security improvement: RCU system password can be used only by RCU actions</li>
  <li>MyST Studio UI was performing slower than desired as it was making a lot of redundant API calls to the backend</li>
  <li>You can now add additional parameters to be taken by the OFMW installation. e.g: -Doui.additional.args=-ignoreSysPrereqs</li>
  <li>You can now specify the RCU property for OFMW 12.2.1: soa-profile-type=LARGE, which will use partitioning on the SOA schemas</li>
